question are are many queries and for every querieshave left and right and for every left and right in the nums 
find out its all the subarrays and suppose the subarray is [7,8,5,3]
then you can do this operatiosn :- 
- Simultaneously replace a[i] with a[i] XOR a[i + 1] for all indices i except the last one.
- Remove the last element of a.

approach and the observations :-

suppose you have l and r and the l and r looks like [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5] in the nums

now find all its subarray ans then take the maximum XOR value out of it 
then what u can do 
queries[i] = [x1,x2];

[x1,x2,x3,x4,x5] // 5 elements

[x1^x2 , x2^x3 , x3^x4 , x4^x5] // 4 elements

[(x1^x2)^(x2^x3),  (x2^x3)^(x3^x4),  (x3^x4)^(x4^x5)]    // length = 3

[(x1^x3)^(x2^x4),  (x2^x4)^(x3^x5)]    // length = 2

[x1 ^ x5]    // length = 1


means to find the maximum XOR value between l and r 
len = 1:   a     b     c     d
len = 2:   a^b   b^c   c^d
len = 3:   a^b^c b^c^d
len = 4:   a^b^c^d


Let’s say nums = [a, b, c, d].
For len = 2:

i=0, j=1:  xScore[0][1] = xScore[0][0] ^ xScore[1][1] = a ^ b
i=1, j=2:  xScore[1][2] = xScore[1][1] ^ xScore[2][2] = b ^ c
i=2, j=3:  xScore[2][3] = xScore[2][2] ^ xScore[3][3] = c ^ d

# What is xScore[i][j]?
xScore[i][j] means:

The XOR of the subarray from index i to index j (inclusive).

Example:

If nums = [a, b, c, d]
xScore[0][2] = a ^ b ^ c
xScore[1][3] = b ^ c ^ d


for len = 1
nums:  a    b    c    d
       ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
XOR:   a    b    c    d

Building longer ranges using smaller ranges
xScore[i][j] = XOR(nums[i..j])


We can reuse two overlapping smaller results
xScore[i][j-1] = XOR(nums[i..j-1])
xScore[i+1][j] = XOR(nums[i+1..j])


If you XOR these two, the overlapping middle part cancels out, leaving nums[i] ^ nums[j].
But here’s the key — in XOR, if we take:

( nums[i] ^ nums[i+1] ^ ... ^ nums[j-1] ) 
^ ( nums[i+1] ^ ... ^ nums[j-1] ^ nums[j] )



# how i am doing this : xScore[i][j] = xScore[i][j-1] ^ xScore[i+1][j];

->

Example array
[x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]   // n = 5


Length = 1
Every subarray of length 1 is just the element itself
xScore[0][0] = x1
xScore[1][1] = x2
xScore[2][2] = x3
xScore[3][3] = x4
xScore[4][4] = x5


Length = 2
We take XOR of two adjacent elements:

[x1 ^ x2]   [x2 ^ x3]   [x3 ^ x4]   [x4 ^ x5]



Length = 3
To get XOR of x1, x2, x3:
We know:

xScore[0][1] = x1 ^ x2 (first 2)

xScore[1][2] = x2 ^ x3 (last 2)

xScore[0][2] = xScore[0][1] ^ xScore[1][2]
             = (x1 ^ x2) ^ (x2 ^ x3)
             = x1 ^ x3   // because x2 cancels out
[(x1^x2)^(x2^x3),  (x2^x3)^(x3^x4),  (x3^x4)^(x4^x5)]

Length = 4
Same idea — use results from length = 3 and cancel middle terms:

[(x1^x3)^(x2^x4),  (x2^x4)^(x3^x5)]

Level 1 (len=1):   x1       x2       x3       x4       x5
                   / \     / \     / \     / \
Level 2 (len=2): x1^x2  x2^x3  x3^x4  x4^x5

Level 3 (len=3):x1^x3  x2^x4  x3^x5

                /  \
Level 5 (len=5):x1^x5


Why xScore[i][j] = xScore[i][j-1] ^ xScore[i+1][j] works
xScore[i][j-1] = XOR of elements from i to j-1

xScore[i+1][j] = XOR of elements from i+1 to j

XORing them cancels out the middle segment (from i+1 to j-1), leaving nums[i] ^ nums[j] only in effect but extended recursively.

It’s the same pattern as above — build larger segments by combining overlapping smaller segments.
